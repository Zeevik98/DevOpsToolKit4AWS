Lambda Details:
Runtime: Python 3.12
Memory: 256MB
Timeout: 5 minutes (300 seconds)

For using the ACM servics lambda which utilaise the native AWS servicees to be used as a single source of truth for all CA cwrts in the organisation there are few steps needed:
1.Lambda execution policy:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "acm:ListCertificates",
                "acm:DescribeCertificate",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sns:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:*:*:CertificateAlerts"
        }
    ]
}

2.Creation of SNS topic:
The ARN of the topic will be used as an enviormental variables.
3.Mapping and uploading ALL the relvant and used certificates to the ACM. Without this the lambda will not be effective.
